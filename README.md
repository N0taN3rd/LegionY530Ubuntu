# Installing Ubuntu on the Legion Y530

This repository provides scripts and a step by step on how to get Ubuntu running on the Lenovo Legion Y530.


These steps were tested on a Legion with the following Specs, but should work for all configurations:

* i7-8750H
* 32GB DDR4
* 1920x1080 Resolution (60Hz)
* 512GB NVMe SSD + 500GB SATA SSD
* Geforce GTX 1050Ti

However this should work on all configurations.

#### If at any point the machine becomes unresponsive, you can use Magic SysRq to reboot safely

Remember: *<b>R</b>eboot <b>E</b>ven <b>I</b>f <b>S</b>ystem <b>U</b>tterly <b>B</b>roken*

To use Magic SysRq, hold down the right Alt key and PrtSc, and then type (In Order) R, E, I, S, U, B. The machine should then reboot. If for some reason this doesn't work, then hold the power button down to power off the machine. 

#### If the machine freezes shortly after login or before the login screen appears, follow the steps section 'disable nouveau modeset' under Additional Notes. These steps will have to be followed at every boot until the nvidia drivers are installed.
