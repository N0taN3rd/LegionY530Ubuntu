### Getting Airplane mode button working

The airplane mode button seems to work in TTY mode, but not in GUI mode. this can be fixed by setting the xmodmap for the keycode of the button in GUI mode. To get this working, follow the steps below. 

run the command `gedit ~/.Xmodmap`    
add the following contents, then save the file    
` keycode 255 = XF86WLAN NoSymbol XF86WLAN `   
run the following command ` gedit ~/.config/autostart/my-xmodmap.desktop`    
add the following content, replacing <username> with your username, then save the file          

``` 
[Desktop Entry]
Name=MyXmodmap   
Exec=/usr/bin/xmodmap /home/<username>/.Xmodmap
Terminal=false
Type=Application
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
```
 
run the command ` chmod +x ~/.config/autostart/my-xmodmap.desktop`

restart the computer. 

The airplane mode button should now work properly

### Setting Governor to performance to prevent lag on battery

:no_entry_sign: #### This may decrease battery life, proceed with caution :no_entry_sign:

The default governor for battery power is balanced. You may notice some lag in certain activities, most notably opening GNOME overview. You can use cpufrequtils to force the governor to performance, which mitigates these performance issues.

To configure cpufrequtils, follow the steps below:     

run the command ` sudo apt install -y cpufrequtils`    
run the command ` sudo nano /etc/default/cpufrequtils`    
add ` SCALING_GOVERNOR="performance"` to the end of the file     
run the command ` sudo systemctl disable ondemand`    
reboot the computer     
run the below command with the laptop unplugged. If the governor is set correctly, the terminal should output "performance"       
` cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor`   

the output of the above command will differ from the screenshot below based on your desktop environment, shell or CPU. the below screenshot is taken from 18.04 with GNOME desktop environment, zsh, and the 8750H (6C/12T)
