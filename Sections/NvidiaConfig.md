In the terminal, run the following commands, following any prompts    
`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa`    
`sudo apt install -y nvidia-driver-415 nvidia-prime`

### Verify that the Nvidia drivers and Prime packages are installed and configured correctly.
run the following series of commands and verify the output

```
prime-select query 
``` 
Should output 'nvidia'
```
sudo prime-select intel 
```
Should output text similar to 'Selecting profile intel'
```
prime-select query 
```
Should now output 'intel'

If the above commands complete successfully, then you have successfully configured the nvidia drivers.
